#  To-Day

I wanted a very simple Mac menubar app that showed a list of items that I could check off over the day. Nothing long term, just day-by-day.

Every app I found had a terrific list of features, most of which I didn't want, so I wrote my own in SwiftUI for macOS 13.0 or later.

Use the **Edit Todosâ€¦** menu item to add, delete, edit and move your todos. Select them in the menu to mark them as complete or incomplete.

There are only three settings: **Show Completed** lets you choose how to display, hide or delete the completed todos, **Sort Todos** allows you to sort the todos by the creation date & time or by title, and **Launch on Login** sets whether you want the app to start automatically when you log in.

This app is free, but if you'd like to support my work, please [Buy Me a Coffee](https://ko-fi.com/H2H3BU7SI).

If you'd like to contact me, I'm [@troz@mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/@troz) on Mastodon.

#### Things to fix:

- [x] Editing - SwiftUI jumps the insertion cursor to the end of the field when editing an existing todo.
- [x] Keyboard shortcuts for deleting and moving.
- [x] Allow clicking anywhere in the text area to start editing
- [x] Lint & tidy up project
- [x] Fix Shift-tab so it goes from 2 to 1 and not from 2 to new
- [x] Work out how to add release notes to Sparkle window
- [ ] VoiceOver - not yet possible to set VocieOver text in menus
- [x] More completion options
- [x] German localisation
- [x] Allow sorting by title
- [ ] More Localisations
- [x] Option-click on Delete All to delete without confirmation

## Sparkle process

- Archive app
- Distribute for Direct Distribution, using Apple notary service
- Mount read-write DMG, export notarised app and copy into read-write DMG
- Configure DMG window as required
- Eject DMG and use Disk Utility to convert to read-only
- Set name to To-Day.dmg and move to Releases folder
- Show Sparkle folder in Finder
- Open Terminal at `artifacts` folder in the level above Sparkle
- `cd` into `sparkle/Sparkle` folder
- Run `./bin/generate_appcast /path/to/Releases`
- Edit Releases/appcast.xml to include release notes (copy format from previous)
- Push to repo
- Run old version and test update process (errors appear in Console)
- Create a git tag like 'release-1.1.1', push tag to GitHub and update Releases to make it the latest.
